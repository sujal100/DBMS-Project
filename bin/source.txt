#!Whether you're frustrated with current PC offerings (and their inflated prices) or are simply looking for a cool project to take on, building a computer from the ground up using off-the-shelf parts can offer significant advantages. In these pages, computer dudes Darrel Wayne Creacy and Carlito Vicencio outline those advantages and then show you how to build the computer of your dreams. The pair begins by explaining what components make up a PC and what you need to think about when selecting those components, before helping you determine your needs and suggesting various configurations to fit those uses. Breaking the process down into its simplest terms, the authors provide component lists for a number of different PC setups: for students, home users, multimedia/home-theater enthusiasts, high-end graphic/video/audio producers, and more. Using plain language and plenty of visual and instructional aids--photos, illustrations, diagrams, step-by-step directions, and more--the authors ensure that even someone (like you!) who knows nothing about technology can build the perfect PC! On a more personal note, the authors are donating a percentage of their income from this book to the Breast Cancer Research Foundationï¾to thank all the women in their lives who have supported them and battled the disease.

#!Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Neyman-Pearson lemma are two fundamental concepts in statistics. Both are about likelihood ratios: Kullback-Leibler divergence is the expected log-likelihood ratio, and the Neyman-Pearson lemma is about error rates of likelihood ratio tests. Exploring this connection gives another statistical interpretation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in terms of the loss of power of the likelihood ratio test when the wrong distribution is used for one of the hypotheses. In this interpretation, the standard non-negativity property of the Kullback-Leibler divergence is essentially a restatement of the optimal property of likelihood ratios established by the Neyman-Pearson lemma. The asymmetry of Kullback-Leibler divergence is overviewed in information geometry.

#!Motivation: Experimental techniques in proteomics have seen rapid development over the last few years. Volume and complexity of the data have both been growing at a similar rate. Accordingly, data management and analysis are one of the major challenges in proteomics. Flexible algorithms are required to handle changing experimental setups and to assist in developing and validating new methods. In order to facilitate these studies, it would be desirable to have a flexible 'toolbox' of versatile and user-friendly applications allowing for rapid construction of computational workflows in proteomics. Results: We describe a set of tools for proteomics data analysis---TOPP, The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline. TOPP provides a set of computational tools which can be easily combined into analysis pipelines even by non-experts and can be used in proteomics workflows. These applications range from useful utilities (file format conversion, peak picking) over wrapper applications for known applications (e.g. Mascot) to completely new algorithmic techniques for data reduction and data analysis. We anticipate that TOPP will greatly facilitate rapid prototyping of proteomics data evaluation pipelines. As such, we describe the basic concepts and the current abilities of TOPP and illustrate these concepts in the context of two example applications: the identification of peptides from a raw dataset through database search and the complex analysis of a standard addition experiment for the absolute quantitation of biomarkers. The latter example demonstrates TOPP's ability to construct flexible analysis pipelines in support of complex experimental setups. Availability: The TOPP components are available as open-source software under the lesser GNU public license (LGPL).

#!We consider a problem motivated by the desire to provide flexible, rate-based, quality of service guarantees for packets sent over input queued switches and switch networks. Our focus is solving a type of online traffic scheduling problem, whose input at each time step is a set of desired traffic rates through the switch network. These traffic rates in general cannot be exactly achieved since they assume arbitrarily small fractions of packets can be transmitted at each time step. The goal of the traffic scheduling problem is to closely approximate the given sequence of traffic rates by a sequence of transmissions in which only whole packets are sent. We prove worst-case bounds on the additional buffer use, which we call backlog, that results from using such an approximation.We first consider the N × N, input queued, crossbar switch. Our main result is an online packet-scheduling algorithm using no speedup that guarantees backlog at most (N+1)2/4 packets at each input port and each output port. Upper bounds on worst-case backlog have been proved for the case of constant fluid schedules, such as the N2-2N+2 bound of Chang, Chen, and Huang (INFOCOM, 2000). Our main result for the crossbar switch is the first, to our knowledge, to bound backlog in terms of switch size N for arbitrary, time-varying fluid schedules, without using speedup.Our main result for Banyan networks is an exact characterization of the speedup required to maintain bounded backlog, in terms of polytopes derived from the network topology.

#!The field of supply chain management has been growing at a rapid pace in recent years, both as a research area and as a practical discipline. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of product covering problems in 3-tier supply chain models, and present natural complete problems for the classes W[3] and W[4] in parameterized complexity theory. This seems the first group of natural complete problems for higher levels in the parameterized intractability hierarchy (i.e., the W-hierarchy), and the first precise complexity characterizations of certain optimization problems in the research of supply chain management. Our results also derive strong computational lower bounds and inapproximability for these optimization problems.

#!To simulate adaptive agents with abilities matching those of their real-world counterparts, a natural approach is to incorporate adaptation mechanisms such as classical conditioning into agent-based simulation. Existing models for adaptation mechanisms are usually based on quantitative methods such as DST. In contrast, agent-based simulation is usually based on qualitative, logical languages. To bridge this gap, this paper puts forward an integrative approach to simulate and analyse the conditioning process of an adaptive agent, which integrates quantitative and qualitative aspects within one temporal specification language. The approach comprises (1) simulation of adaptation mechanisms in an executable language, (2) automated analysis of dynamic properties against simulation traces, and (3) verification of representation relations for internal agent states against simulation traces. Furthermore, the approach addresses the issue of realism of intermediate states in a simulated conditioning process.

#!The polynomial classifier (PC) that takes the binomial terms of reduced subspace features as inputs has shown superior performance to multilayer neural networks in pattern classification. In this paper, we propose a class-specific feature polynomial classifier (CFPC) that extracts class-specific features from class-specific subspaces, unlike the ordinary PC that uses a class-independent subspace. The CFPC can be viewed as a hybrid of ordinary PC and projection distance method. The class-specific features better separate one class from the others, and the incorporation of class-specific projection distance further improves the separability. The connecting weights of CFPC are efficiently learned class-by-class to minimize the mean square error on training samples. To justify the promise of CFPC, we have conducted experiments of handwritten digit recognition and numeral string recognition on the NIST Special Database 19 (SD19). The digit recognition task was also benchmarked on two standard databases USPS and MNIST. The results show that the performance of CFPC is superior to that of ordinary PC, and is competitive with support vector classifiers (SVCs).

#!Desirability of an action, often referred to as utility or value, is determined by various factors, such as the probability and timing of expected reward. We investigated how performance of monkeys in an oculomotor serial reaction time task is influenced by multiple motivational factors. The animals produced a series of visually-guided eye movements, while the sequence of target locations and the location of the rewarded target were systematically manipulated. The results show that error rates as well as saccade latencies were consistently influenced by the number of remaining movements necessary to obtain a reward. In addition, when the animal produced multiple saccades before fixating a given target, the first saccade tended to be directed towards the rewarded location, suggesting that saccades to rewarded location and visual target might be programmed concurrently. These results show that monkeys can utilize information about the required sequence of movements to update their subjective values.

#!Computation of similarity between categorical data objects in unsupervised learning is an important data mining problem. We propose a method to compute distance between two attribute values of same attribute for unsupervised learning. This approach is based on the fact that similarity of two attribute values is dependent on their relationship with other attributes. Computational cost of this method is linear with respect to number of data objects in data set. To see the effectiveness of our proposed distance measure, we use proposed distance measure with K-mode clustering algorithm to cluster various categorical data sets. Significant improvement in clustering accuracy is observed as compared to clustering results obtained using traditional K-mode clustering algorithm.

#t2006
#cTheory of Computing Systems
#index70
#!We study the problem of how resilient networks are to node faults. Specifically, we investigate the question of how many faults a network can sustain and still contain a large (i.e., linear-sized) connected component with approximately the same expansion as the original fault-free network. We use a pruning technique that culls away those parts of the faulty network that have poor expansion. The faults may occur at random or be caused by an adversary. Our techniques apply in either case. In the adversarial setting we prove that for every network with expansion $\alpha,$ a large connected component with basically the same expansion as the original network exists for up to a constant times $\alpha \cdot n$ faults. We show this result is tight in the sense that every graph G of size n and uniform expansion $\alpha(\cdot)$ can be broken into components of size o(n) with $\omega(\alpha(n) \cdot n)$ faults. Unlike the adversarial case, the expansion of a graph gives a very weak bound on its resilience to random faults. While it is the case, as before, that there are networks of uniform expansion $\Omega(1/{\rm log}\, n)$ that are not resilient against a fault probability of a constant times $1/{\log}\, n,$ it is also observed that there are networks of uniform expansion $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ that are resilient against a constant fault probability. Thus, we introduce a different parameter, called the span of a graph, which gives us a more precise handle on the maximum fault probability. We use the span to show the first known results for the effect of random faults on the expansion of d-dimensional meshes.

#!The self-organization of particles in a two phase system in the coexistence region through a diffusive mechanism is known as Ostwald ripening. This phenomenon is an example of a multiscale problem in that the microscopic level interaction of the particles can greatly impact the macroscale or observable morphology of the system. Ostwald ripening is studied here through the use of a mesoscopic model which is a stochastic partial integrodifferential equation that is derived from a spin exchange Ising model. This model is studied through the use of recently developed and benchmarked spectral schemes for the simulation of solutions to stochastic partial differential equations. The typical cluster size is observed to grow like t1/3 over range of times with faster growth at later times. The results included here also demonstrate the effect of adjusting the interparticle interaction on the morphological evolution of the system at the macroscopic level.

#!Recently the declining costs of computer hardware, combined with the rapidly increasing costs of software systems have led to considerable discussion of computer organizations. When a computing system is viewed as a data structure, a control structure, and a processing structure designed to execute algorithms, it is reasonable to consider how this system can be optimized in both a hardware sense, and in the sense of reducing the total system software costs. A reasonable approach to greater efficiency is to design computer systems whose structure more closely resembles that of the higher level language in which the algorithms are to be expressed.

#*Three-Level Caching for Efficient Query Processing in Large Web Search Engines
#@Xiaohui Long,Torsten Suel
#t2006
#cWorld Wide Web
#index86
#!Large web search engines have to answer thousands of queries per second with interactive response times. Due to the sizes of the data sets involved, often in the range of multiple terabytes, a single query may require the processing of hundreds of megabytes or more of index data. To keep up with this immense workload, large search engines employ clusters of hundreds or thousands of machines, and a number of techniques such as caching, index compression, and index and query pruning are used to improve scalability. In particular, two-level caching techniques cache results of repeated identical queries at the frontend, while index data for frequently used query terms are cached in each node at a lower level. We propose and evaluate a three-level caching scheme that adds an intermediate level of caching for additional performance gains. This intermediate level attempts to exploit frequently occurring pairs of terms by caching intersections or projections of the corresponding inverted lists. We propose and study several offline and online algorithms for the resulting weighted caching problem, which turns out to be surprisingly rich in structure. Our experimental evaluation based on a large web crawl and real search engine query log shows significant performance gains for the best schemes, both in isolation and in combination with the other caching levels. We also observe that a careful selection of cache admission and eviction policies is crucial for best overall performance.

This practical, problem-solving guide is ideal if you're an engineer, programmer, or researcher writing an application for one of the legions of platforms on which C++ runs. The algorithms provided in C++ Cookbook will jump-start your development by giving you some basic building blocks that you don't have to develop on your own. Less a tutorial than a problem-solver, the book addresses many of the most common problems you're likely encounter--whether you've been programming in C++ for years or you're relatively new to the language. Here are just some of the time-consuming tasks this book contains practical solutions for: Reading the contents of a directory Creating a singleton class Date and time parsing/arithmetic String and text manipulation Working with files Parsing XML Using the standard containers Typical of O'Reilly's "Cookbook" series, C++ Cookbook is written in a straightforward format, featuring recipes that contain problem statements and code solutions, and apply not to hypothetical situations, but those that you're likely to encounter. A detailed explanation then follows each recipe in order to show you how and why the solution works. This question-solution-discussion format is a proven teaching method, as any fan of the "Cookbook" series can attest to. This book will move quickly to the top of your list of essential C++ references.

#!This paper presents an algorithm to model volumetric data and other one for non-rigid registration of such models using spheres formulated in the geometric algebra framework. The proposed algorithm for modeling, as opposite to the Union of Spheres method, reduces the number of entities (spheres) used to model 3D data. Our proposal is based in marching cubes idea using, however, spheres, while the Union of Spheres uses Delaunay tetrahedrization. The non-rigid registration is accomplished in a deterministic annealing scheme. At the preprocessing stage we segment the objects of interest by a segmentation method based on texture information. This method is embedded in a region growing scheme. As our final application, we present a scheme for surgical object tracking using again geometric algebra techniques.

Uses progressive enhancement techniques to ensure graceful degradation (which makes sites usable in all browsers). Shows readers how to write their own Ajax scripts instead of relying on third-party libraries.Web site designers love the idea of Ajax--of creating Web pages in which information can be updated without refreshing the entire page. But for those who aren't hard-core programmers, enhancing pages using Ajax can be a challenge. Even more of a challenge is making sure those pages work for all users. In Bulletproof Ajax, author Jeremy Keith demonstrates how developers comfortable with CSS and (X)HTML can build Ajax functionality without frameworks, using the ideas of graceful degradation and progressive enhancement to ensure that the pages work for all users. Throughout this step-by-step guide, his emphasis is on best practices with an approach to building Ajax pages called Hijax, which improves flexibility and avoids worst-case scenarios.

#!Browsing activities are an important source of information to build profiles of the user interests and personalize the human-computer interaction during information seeking tasks. Visited pages are easily collectible, e.g., from browsers' histories and toolbars, or desktop search tools, and they often contain documents related to the current user needs. Nevertheless, menus, advertisements or pages that cover multiple topics affect negatively the advantages of an implicit feedback technique that exploits these data to build and keep updated user profiles. This work describes a technique to collect text relevant to the current needs from sequences of pages visited by the user. The evaluation shows how it outperforms other techniques that consider the whole page contents. We also introduce an improvement based on machine learning techniques that is currently under evaluation.

#@Salem Benferhat,Didier Dubois,Souhila Kaci,Henri Prade

#cInformation Fusion
#index125
#!The bipolar view in preference modeling distinguishes between negative and positive preferences. Negative preferences correspond to what is rejected, considered unacceptable, while positive preferences correspond to what is desired. But what is tolerated (i.e., not rejected) is not necessarily desired. Both negative and positive preferences can be a matter of degree. Bipolar preferences can be represented in possibilistic logic by two separate sets of formulas: prioritized constraints, which describe what is more or less tolerated, and weighted positive preferences, expressing what is particularly desirable. The problem of merging multiple-agent preferences in this bipolar framework is then discussed. Negative and positive preferences are handled separately and are combined in distinct ways. Since negative and positive preferences are stated separately, they may be inconsistent, especially in this context of preference fusion. Consistency can be enforced by restricting what is desirable to what is tolerated. After merging, and once the bipolar consistency is restored, the set of preferred solutions can be logically characterized. Preferred solutions should have the highest possible degree of feasibility, and only constraints with low priority may have to be discarded in case of inconsistency inside negative preferences. Moreover, preferred solutions should satisfy important positive preferences when feasible (positive preferences may be also inconsistent). Two types of preferred solutions can be characterized, either in terms of a disjunctive combination of the weighted positive preferences, or in terms of a cardinality-based evaluation.

#cJournal of Computational Physics
#index127
#!The present paper describes the numerical technique that has been developed, in the framework of the particle-in-cell (PIC) method, to study the dynamics of a nonneutral plasma along the magnetic field lines. In particular, the technique has been employed to simulate the formation and long-term evolution of large-amplitude electrostatic waves experimentally observed in electron plasmas confined in a Penning trap [W. Bertsche, J. Fajans, L. Friedland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 91 (2003) 265003]. Due to the peculiar features of the physical system, namely the existence of different time scales and the presence of a perturbative oscillating potential, ad hoc numerical techniques have been developed. In particular, with a suitable radial decomposition all important two-dimensional phenomena are fully taken into account while keeping the computational effort to that of a standard one-dimensional PIC codes. Moreover, a novel particle loading technique (ergodic loading) has been developed, which ensures a significant reduction of numerical noise. The results obtained with the present technique are in excellent agreement with the experiments [F. Peinetti, W. Bertsche, J. Fajans, J. Wurtele, L. Friedland, Phys. Plasmas 12 (2005) 062112]. Moreover, results presented here furnish clear evidences of the close relationship between the observed nonlinear structures and the Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal modes.

#!We introduce the logical story behind file input in ACL2 and discuss the types of theorems that can be proven about file-reading operations. We develop a low level library for reasoning about the primitive input routines. We then develop a representation for Unicode text, and implement efficient functions to translate our representation to and from the UTF-8 encoding scheme. We introduce an efficient function to read UTF-8-encoded files, and prove that when files are well formed, the function produces valid Unicode text which corresponds to the contents of the file.We find exhaustive testing to be a useful technique for proving many theorems in this work. We show how ACL2 can be directed to prove a theorem by exhaustive testing.

#!Finite difference approximations of the second derivative in space appearing in, parabolic, incompletely parabolic systems of, and 2nd-order hyperbolic, partial differential equations are considered. If the solution is pointwise bounded, we prove that finite difference approximations of those classes of equations can be closed with two orders less accuracy at the boundary without reducing the global order of accuracy.This result is generalised to initial-boundary value problems with an mth-order principal part. Then, the boundary accuracy can be lowered m orders.Further, it is shown that schemes using summation-by-parts operators that approximate second derivatives are pointwise bounded. Linear and nonlinear computations, including the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, corroborate the theoretical results.

#!In this paper we present a framework for scenarios in simulation games. It is used to support developing, using, and managing complex and dynamic simulation games, and it supports the achievement of the game's learning goal. Especially game facilitation is increasingly challenging due to the nature of these simulation games. The framework consists of a number of conditions, rules and actions, based on the concept of production systems from artificial intelligence, and it is presented as a component of Zeigler's experimental frame. This has been successfully used in the Distributor Game, which is the first of a series of management games developed for today's supply chain management challenges. Further research will focus on the extension of the set of conditions, rules and actions, and on visualizing and managing the interdependencies between the simulation game, its scenario, and the players.

#*Fusionplex: resolution of data inconsistencies in the integration of heterogeneous information sources
#@Amihai Motro,Philipp Anokhin
#t2006
#cInformation Fusion
#index169
#!Fusionplex is a system for integrating multiple heterogeneous and autonomous information sources that uses data fusion to resolve factual inconsistencies among the individual sources. To accomplish this, the system relies on source features, which are meta-data on the merits of each information source; for example, the recentness of the data, its accuracy, its availability, or its cost. The fusion process is controlled with several parameters: (1) with a vector of feature weights, each user defines an individual notion of data utility; (2) with thresholds of acceptance, users ensure minimal performance of their data, excluding from the fusion process data that are too old, too costly, or lacking in authority, or numeric data that are too high, too low, or obvious outliers; and, ultimately, (3) in naming a particular fusion function to be used for each attribute (for example, average, maximum, or simply any) users implement their own interpretation of fusion. Several simple extensions to SQL are all that is needed to allow users to state these resolution parameters, thus ensuring that the system is easy to use. Altogether, Fusionplex provides its users with powerful and flexible, yet simple, control over the fusion process. In addition, Fusionplex supports other critical integration requirements, such as information source heterogeneity, dynamic evolution of the information environment, quick ad-hoc integration, and intermittent source availability. The methods described in this paper were implemented in a prototype system that provides complete Web-based integration services for remote clients.

#!This conference, organized jointly by the National Physical Laboratory and the Institute of Mathematics and Its Applications, was a sequel to the one on unconstrained optimization held in January 1971. The intention was that the papers should all be expository in nature, providing a broad survey of fundamental and useful techniques. In spite of the extra constraints imposed by the Emergency Power Regulations (the proceedings of the first day being held in an atmosphere of increasing gloom due to the fact that lights were not permitted at N.P.L. that day) the aim of the Conference was achieved. The standard of the papers was unusually high and clearly much effort had been taken, both collectively and individually; one small, but useful, indication being the use of a common notation. The major criticism that could be leveled would be to do with the amount of material covered in some of the sessions making it a very intensive course indeed, and leading, perhaps, to some feeling of mental indigestion. Fortunately, pre- or post-prints of most of the talks were available or promised, and the complete proceedings are to be published.

#!This paper presents a new algorithm to produce a near optimal mixture of experts model (MEM) architecture for a continuous mapping. The MEM is applied to a new method incorporating photon scatter for designing compensators for intensity modulated radiation therapy. The algorithm utilizes the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm to partition data before training commences. A reduction in the size of training sets also allows the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to be implemented. As a result, both training time and validation error are reduced. A 71% reduction in prediction error compared with that of a single neural network is achieved.

#!In this paper we propose a traffic predictor based on multiresolution decomposition for the adaptive bandwidth control in locally controlled self-sizing networks. A selfsizing network can provide quantitative packet-level QoS to aggregate traffic by allocating link/switch capacity automatically and adaptively using online traffic data. In a locally controlled network such as Internet, resource allocation decisions are made at the node level. We show that wavelet based adaptive bandwidth control method performs better than other popular methods like Gaussian predictor for such applications. We have compared the performance of different ortho-normal wavelets and found that Haar wavelet is best suited for traffic prediction. We have studied the effect of other wavelet parameters such as size of the window and number of filter coefficients. We also propose a novel adaptive wavelet predictor which can adapt very well to the changes of incoming bursty traffic.

#!The real-time execution of contemporary complex media applications requires energy-efficient processing capabilities beyond those of current superscalar processors. We observe that the complexity of contemporary media applications requires support for multiple forms of parallelism, including ILP, TLP, and various forms of DLP, such as subword SIMD, short vectors, and streams. Based on our observations, we propose an architecture, called ALP, that efficiently integrates all of these forms of parallelism with evolutionary changes to the programming model and hardware. The novel part of ALP is a DLP technique called SIMD vectors and streams (SVectors/SStreams), which is integrated within a conventional superscalar-based CMP/SMT architecture with subword SIMD. This technique lies between subword SIMD and vectors, providing significant benefits over the former at a lower cost than the latter. Our evaluations show that each form of parallelism supported by ALP is important. Specifically, SVectors/SStreams are effective, compared to a system with the other enhancements in ALP. They give speedups of 1.1 to 3.4X and energy-delay product improvements of 1.1 to 5.1X for applications with DLP.

#!The numerical accuracy of the Interpolated Differential Operator (IDO) scheme is studied with Fourier analysis for the solutions of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs): advection, diffusion, and Poisson equations. The IDO scheme solves governing equations not only for physical variable but also for first-order spatial derivative. Spatial discretizations are based on Hermite interpolation functions with both of them. In the Fourier analysis for the IDO scheme, the Fourier coefficients of the physical variable and the first-order derivative are coupled by the equations derived from the governing equations. The analysis shows the IDO scheme resolves all the wavenumbers with higher accuracy than the fourth-order Finite Difference (FD) and Compact Difference (CD) schemes for advection equation. In particular, for high wavenumbers, the accuracy is superior to that of the sixth-order Combined Compact Difference (CCD) scheme. The diffusion and Poisson equations are also more accurately solved in comparison with the FD and CD schemes. These results show that the IDO scheme guarantees highly resolved solutions for all the terms of fluid flow equations.

#!Motivation: Protein sequence alignment plays a critical role in computational biology as it is an integral part in many analysis tasks designed to solve problems in comparative genomics, structure and function prediction, and homology modeling. Methods: We have developed novel sequence alignment algorithms that compute the alignment between a pair of sequences based on short fixed- or variable-length high-scoring subsequences. Our algorithms build the alignments by repeatedly selecting the highest scoring pairs of subsequences and using them to construct small portions of the final alignment. We utilize PSI-BLAST generated sequence profiles and employ a profile-to-profile scoring scheme derived from PICASSO. Results: We evaluated the performance of the computed alignments on two recently published benchmark datasets and compared them against the alignments computed by existing state-of-the-art dynamic programming-based profile-to-profile local and global sequence alignment algorithms. Our results show that the new algorithms achieve alignments that are comparable with or better than those achieved by existing algorithms. Moreover, our results also showed that these algorithms can be used to provide better information as to which of the aligned positions are more reliable---a critical piece of information for comparative modeling applications.

#!It is well known that one-step Rosenbrock methods may suffer from order reduction for very stiff problems. By considering two-step methods we construct s-stage methods where all stage values have stage order s-1. The proposed class of methods is stable in the sense of zero-stability for arbitrary stepsize sequences. Furthermore there exist L(α)-stable methods with large α for s=4,...,8. Using the concept of effective order we derive methods having order s for constant stepsizes. Numerical experiments show an efficiency superior to RODAS for more stringent tolerances.

#!To exercise better control on the lower tail of the loss distribution and to easily describe the investor's risk attitude, a new class of coherent risk measures is proposed in this paper by taking the minimization of p-norms of lower losses with respect to some reference point. We demonstrate that the new risk measure has satisfactory mathematical properties such as convexity, continuity with respect to parameters included in its definition, the relations between two new risk measures are also examined. The application of the new risk measures for optimal portfolio selection is illustrated by using trade data from the Chinese stock markets. Empirical results not only support our theoretical conclusions, but also show the practicability of the portfolio selection model with our new risk measures.

#!Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) play a significant role in enhancing rural development in developing countries. However, rural ICT projects are confronted with challenges that result in projects that are not sustainable, or fail altogether. These challenges include access to infrastructure, limited formal education, insufficient training and capacity building, financial and political constraints, and social and cultural challenges. Sustainability is key to the effectiveness of a rural ICT project, therefore it is important to understand the concept and categories associated with ICT project sustainability in rural areas. The categories are social and cultural, institutional, economic, political, and technological sustainability. An exploration of the categories of sustainability is undertaken on an ICT project in rural Dwesa.

#*MRP Rescheduling heuristics with capacity extension under deterministic demand

#!The multi-stage, multi-machine capacitated lot-sizing problem (MSMMCLSP) consists of scheduling the production of one product in a multi-machine production system with a multi-stage structure. Machine capacity is reserved for the production of the end item but can be extended by working overtime (overtime capacity). When a lot size is positive in a specific period, it can be loaded on all machines without exceeding the sum of the regular and overtime capacity limits. In previous research [Rong, C., Takahashi, K., & Morikawa, K. (2005). A new heuristic method for capacitated lot-sizing in multi-stage, multi-machine production systems. Journal of Japan Industrial Management Association, 56(5), in press], we have proposed a rescheduling heuristic to determine a feasible and sufficient solution for the MSMMCLSP with only regular capacity limits, in comparison with Franca et al.'s heuristic method. However, the mechanism of rescheduling in regular time has not optimum (or near optimum) performance for the MSMMCLSP with capacity extension. Preliminary examination revealed that overtime production also has situation-dependent advantages and disadvantages with the combination of various planning parameters. This study, therefore, develops an integrated heuristic that guarantees an optimal solution for general MSMMCLSP by combining the rescheduling mechanism and overtime production. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed heuristics by using computational tests with various planning parameters.

#*Large area micro hot embossing of Pyrex glass with GC mold machined by dicing
#@Masaharu Takahashi,Yoichi Murakoshi,Ryutaro Maeda,Kohei Hasegawa

#cMicrosystem Technologies
#index274
#!Micro/Nano imprinting or hot embossing is currently a target of interest for industrial production of micro and Nano devices for the low cost aspect. In Fluidic MEMS (Micro Electromechanical Systems) applications, polymer materials have been widely employed for their low cost to fabricate the economical products (Becker and Heim in Sens Acuators A 83:120&#x2013;135, 2000; Becker and Gaertner in Mol Biotechnol 82:89&#x2013;99, 2001). However glasses are much more suitable for the higher temperature applications or under the stronger chemical environments. Moreover UV absorption of glass materials is much less than that of polymers, which is the advantage for bio-analysis. In Optical MEMS as well, glasses are good candidate materials for the better optical properties, such as high refractive index, low UV absorption and others. Although wet etching of glasses is widely employed for fabrication of fluidic MEMS devices, the wet etching is not satisfactory for the low machining resolution, the isotropic etched profile and poor roughness of the fabricated structures. Dry etching of glasses is then an alternative for Micro/Nano structuring, but the etching rate is extremely low (order of 0.1&#x00a0;&#x03bc;m/min) and the cost is too high because of the expensive RIE (Reactive Ion Etching) facility. Above mentioned is the reason why we are interested in hot embossing or imprinting of glasses of Micro/Nano scale. In our previous study, Micro/Nano imprinting was developed for Pyrex glasses using GC (Glassy Carbon) mold prepared by FIB machining (Takahashi et al. in Symposium on DTIP 2004 pp 441&#x2013;446, 2004). The disadvantage of FIB machining is limited area of etching. The typical area of FIB is less than several hundreds micrometer square. This is the reason why we tried the large area of embossing using GC mold fabricated by dicing machine. Micro hot embossed test structures were successfully demonstrated with good fidelity. Fabricated micro structures can be applied for fabrication of microchamber array for PCR (Akagi et al. in Sci Techol Adv Mater 5:343&#x2013;349, 2004; Nagai et al. in Anal Chem 73:1043&#x2013;1047, 2001).

#!Polymeric microfluidic chips are an enabling component for cost-effective, point of care analytical devices for pharmaceutical, agriculture, health, biological and medical applications. The microfluidic structures can be completed with active elements like pumps and valves as well as sensor components for more complex so called total analysis systems. Often, systems are designed as reader and disposable cartridge where the fluidic structures are simple devices that will be inserted into the reader, which executes the analytical protocol and displays the information in digital form, and disposed after completion of the analysis. In this paper, a hybrid fabrication approach was employed to build a polymeric microfluidic device, so-called sweatstick, suitable for collecting small, precise amounts (600&#x00a0;&#x03bc;l) of human sweat, which were further analyzed for the amount of calcium ions indicating bone mass loss. The device was assembled from different parts fabricated by ultra deep X-ray lithography, precision micro-milling, and molding. Surface treatment of liquid exposed surfaces by oxygen plasma ensures hydrophilic behavior and proper capillary action. Preliminary testing of the device was performed by collecting defined amounts of sweat simulant and determining the calcium ion content using a fluorescent technique. The results for low calcium ion concentration typical for human sweat were excellent and repeatable with variation less than 5% demonstrating the ability to perform indirect bone loss measurements.

#!Modern real-time systems consist of complex parallel and heterogeneous architectures. Early design decisions, such as the partitioning of functionality onto architecture building blocks and the choice of algorithms, have a large impact on the quality of the resulting platform. In order to support the designer during this concept phase we have developed our performance evaluation framework SystemQ. In this paper, we demonstrate why multiclass queuing networks as used by SystemQ are a natural abstraction for evaluating network processing platforms. In particular we reveal the impact of scheduling policies on the Quality-of- Service, such as the residence time of network traffic in the system. For the same stimuli the packet latency can vary by more than one order of magnitude if only one queuing discipline in the system is modified.

#!Mobile handsets have found an important place in modern society, with hundreds of millions currently in use. The majority of these devices use inherently weak authentication mechanisms, based upon passwords and PINs. This paper presents a feasibility study into a biometric-based technique, known as keystroke analysis &#x2013; which authenticates the user based upon their typing characteristic. In particular, this paper identifies two typical handset interactions, entering telephone numbers and typing text messages, and seeks to authenticate the user during their normal handset interaction. It was found that neural network classifiers were able to perform classification with average equal error rates of 12.8%. Based upon these results, the paper concludes by proposing a flexible and robust framework to permit the continuous and transparent authentication of the user, thereby maximising security and minimising user inconvenience, to service the needs of the insecure and evermore functional mobile handset.

#!In this paper, we focus on affect recognition from text in order to facilitate sensitive and expressive communication in computer-mediated environments. Our model for analyzing affect conveyed by text is tailored to handle the style and specifics of informal online conversations. The motivation behind our approach is to improve social interactivity and emotional expressiveness of real-time messaging.In order to estimate affect in text, our model processes symbolic cues, such as emoticons, detects and transforms abbreviations, and employs natural language processing techniques for word/phrase/sentence-level analysis, e.g. by considering relations among words in a sentence. As a result of the analysis, text can be categorized into emotional states and communicative functions. A designed graphical representation of a user (avatar) displays emotions and social behaviour driven by text and performs natural idle movements. The proposed system shows promising results on affect recognition in real examples of online conversation.

#!A module-based modeling method was developed to analyze the production-distribution systems by using a discrete event simulation with ARENA. Excel VBA was also adopted to automatically generate the simulation programs. Using the proposed method, one can quickly create a multistage, multi-item supply chain system such as serials, convergent, divergent or general networks, for analyzing the performance of a supply chain. Both inventory control and shipment consolidation policy were considered in this study. A number of outputs can be used as a performance measure in the decision making; for example, transportation costs, inventory level and costs, and the fill rate. An actual application model was generated using the proposed method. The result shows that the module-based method is a powerful tool for modeling the supply chain systems.

#*A New Scheme to Realize the Optimum Watermark Detection for the Additive Embedding Scheme with the Spatial Domain
#@Takaaki Fujita,Maki Yoshida,Toru Fujiwara
#t2007
#cIEICE Transactions on Fundamentals of Electronics, Communications and Computer Sciences
#index299
#!A typical watermarking scheme consists of an embedding scheme and a detection scheme. In detecting a watermark, there are two kinds of detection errors, a false positive error (FPE) and a false negative error (FNE). A detection scheme is said to be optimum if the FNE probability is minimized for a given FPE probability. In this paper, we present an optimum watermark detection scheme for an additive embedding scheme with a spatial domain. The key idea of the proposed scheme is to use the differences between two brightnesses for detecting a watermark. We prove that under the same FPE probability the FNE probability of the proposed optimum detection scheme is no more than that of the previous optimum detection scheme for the additive embedding scheme with the spatial domain. Then, it is confirmed that for an actual image, the FNE probability of the proposed optimum detection scheme is much lower than that of the previous optimum detection scheme. Moreover, it is confirmed experimentally that the proposed optimum detection scheme can control the FPE probability strictly so that the FPE probability is close to a given probability.

#!We consider a variant of Heilbronn's triangle problem by asking for a distribution of n points in the d-dimensional unit cube [0, 1]d such that the minimum (two-dimensional) area of a triangle among these n points is as large as possible. Denoting by Δdoff-line (n) and Δdon-line (n) the supremum of the minimum area of a triangle among n points over all distributions of n points in [0, 1]d for the off-line and the on-line situation, respectively, for fixed dimension d ≥ 2 we show that c1ċ(log n)1/(d-1)/n2/(d-1) ≤ Δdoff-line(n) ≤ c'1/n2/d and c2/n2/(d-1) ≤ Δdon-line (n) ≤ c'2/n2/d for constants c1, c2, c'1,c'2 > 0 which depend on d only. Moreover, we provide a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that achieves the lower bound Ω((log n)1/(d-1))/n2/(d-1)) on the minimum area of a triangle among n points in [0, 1]d in the off-line case.

#!Suffix trees and suffix arrays are widely used and largely interchangeable index structures on strings and sequences. Practitioners prefer suffix arrays due to their simplicity and space efficiency while theoreticians use suffix trees due to linear-time construction algorithms and more explicit structure. We narrow this gap between theory and practice with a simple linear-time construction algorithm for suffix arrays. The simplicity is demonstrated with a C&plus;&plus; implementation of 50 effective lines of code. The algorithm is called DC3, which stems from the central underlying concept of difference cover. This view leads to a generalized algorithm, DC, that allows a space-efficient implementation and, moreover, supports the choice of a space--time tradeoff. For any v &isin; &lsqb;1,&nradic;&rsqb;, it runs in O(vn) time using O(n/&vradic;) space in addition to the input string and the suffix array. We also present variants of the algorithm for several parallel and hierarchical memory models of computation. The algorithms for BSP and EREW-PRAM models are asymptotically faster than all previous suffix tree or array construction algorithms.

#!Recently, a great deal of attention has been focused on the construction of exponential integrators for semilinear problems. In this article we describe a MATLAB1 package which aims to facilitate the quick deployment and testing of exponential integrators, of Runge--Kutta, multistep, and general linear type. A large number of integrators are included in this package along with several well-known examples. The so-called &phiv; functions and their evaluation is crucial for accuracy, stability, and efficiency of exponential integrators, and the approach taken here is through a modification of the scaling and squaring technique, the most common approach used for computing the matrix exponential.

#!Personal Networks and PN federations are new networking paradigms that merge concepts from ad hoc, P2P and wireless networks, built around user's needs. Even though they are a promise of a practical achievement of ubiquitous computing, managing security associations in these frameworks proves to be a challenge. We present in this paper a security architecture, including a uniform personal namespace using crypto-based identifiers and a key management scheme based on identity-based cryptography. We also provide an evaluation of our scheme, in terms of computation complexity, communication cost and security.

#!With the diverging improvements in CPU speeds and memory access latencies, detecting and removing memory access bottlenecks becomes increasingly important. In this work we present METRIC, a software framework for isolating and understanding such bottlenecks using partial access traces. METRIC extracts access traces from executing programs without special compiler or linker support. We make four primary contributions. First, we present a framework for extracting partial access traces based on dynamic binary rewriting of the executing application. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm for compressing these traces. The algorithm generates constant space representations for regular accesses occurring in nested loop structures. Third, we use these traces for offline incremental memory hierarchy simulation. We extract symbolic information from the application executable and use this to generate detailed source-code correlated statistics including per-reference metrics, cache evictor information, and stream metrics. Finally, we demonstrate how this information can be used to isolate and understand memory access inefficiencies. This illustrates a potential advantage of METRIC over compile-time analysis for sample codes, particularly when interprocedural analysis is required.

#!In the last years there has been a growing interest worldwide in the application of agent technology for providing dynamic, flexible, and compound services. In this paper we report the design and implementation of a multi-agent system that provides health care-related services to the citizens and visitors of a city. The agents of the system allow the user to access his/her medical record, to find out information about the medical centres of the city, and to make a booking to be visited by a particular kind of doctor. Doctors may access and update the medical record of the patient during a visit, and they may also request the performance of clinical tests on the patient. The results of the tests are automatically stored in the patient's medical record, so that they can be accessed by the doctor in the next visit. Two key issues in the design and implementation of the system are discussed: the definition of a basic medical ontology and the implementation of security measures that preserve the confidentiality of sensitive medical information.

#!In this paper we present an explicit disk-based verification algorithm for Probabilistic Systems defining discrete time/finite state Markov Chains. Given a Markov Chain and an integer k (horizon), our algorithm checks whether the probability of reaching an error state in at most k steps is below a given threshold. We present an implementation of our algorithm within a suitable extension of the Mur&#x03d5; verifier. We call the resulting probabilistic model checker FHP-Mur&#x03d5; (Finite Horizon ProbabilisticMur&#x03d5;). We present experimental results comparing FHP-Mur&#x03d5; with (a finite horizon subset of) PRISM, a state-of-the-art symbolic model checker for Markov Chains. Our experimental results show that FHP-Mur&#x03d5; can handle systems that are out of reach for PRISM, namely those involving arithmetic operations on the state variables (e.g. hybrid systems).

#!Prediction of the cellular location of a protein plays an important role in inferring the function of the protein. Feature extraction is a critical part in prediction systems, requiring raw sequence data to be transformed into appropriate numerical feature vectors while minimizing information loss. In this paper, we present a method for extracting useful features from protein sequence data. The method employs local and global pairwise sequence alignment scores as well as composition-based features. Five different features are used for training support vector machines (SVMs) separately and a weighted majority voting makes a final decision. The overall prediction accuracy evaluated by the 5-fold cross-validation reached 88.53% for the eukaryotic animal data set. Comparing the prediction accuracy of various feature extraction methods, provides a biological insight into the location of targeting information. Our experimental results confirm that our feature extraction methods are very useful for predicting subcellular localization of proteins.

#!Organizations change with the dynamics of the world. To enable organizations to change, certain structures and capabilities are needed. As all processes, a change process has an organization of its own. In this paper it is shown how within a formal organization modeling approach also organizational change processes can be modeled. A generic organization model (covering both organization structure and behavior) for organizational change is presented and formally evaluated for a case study. This model takes into account different phases in a change process considered in Organization Theory literature, such as unfreezing, movement and refreezing. Moreover, at the level of individuals, the internal beliefs and their changes are incorporated in the model. In addition, an internal mental model for (reflective) reasoning about expected role behavior is included in the organization model.

#!In this paper, we propose a novel path-based control method for generating realistic smoke animations. Our method allows an animator to specify a 3D curve for the smoke to follow. Path control is then achieved using a linear (closed) feedback loop to match the velocity field obtained from a 3D flow simulation with a target velocity field. The target velocity field can be generated in a variety of ways and may include the small scale swirling motion characteristic of turbulent flows. We provide several examples of complex smoke paths to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

#!This paper investigates the compositional properties of reusable software components defined with explicit dependencies and behavioural contracts expressing rely-guarantee specifications in the form of communication traces. In this setting, connection of components through their matching ports is indeed compositional and yields a new component or composite that respects its constituents' contracts. Thus the behaviour of the composite is computed from the behaviours of its constituents and is known to conform to the contracts without any new proof.

#!In this paper, we propose an optimization-based approach for Quality of Service (QoS) routing in high-bandwidth networks. We view a network that employs QoS routing as an entity that distributively optimizes some global utility function. By solving the optimization problem, the network is driven to an efficient operating point. In earlier work, it has been shown that when the capacity of the network is large, this optimization takes on a simple form, and once the solution to this optimization problem is found, simple proportional QoS routing schemes will suffice. However, this optimization problem requires global information. We develop a distributed and adaptive algorithm that can efficiently solve the optimization online. Compared with existing QoS routing schemes, the proposed optimization-based approach has the following advantages: 1) the computation and communication overhead can be greatly reduced without sacrificing performance; 2) the operating characteristics of the network can be analytically studied; and 3) the desired operating point can be tuned by choosing appropriate utility functions.

#!Enterprise integration through integrated business information systems (IBIS) is necessary to achieve agility in the current age of hyper-competition. Multi-agent systems (MAS) provide a new paradigm for IBIS development. In this paper, we review the IBIS modeling and MAS literatures and find that the MAS paradigm provides an excellent approach for modeling and implementing IBIS systems. We synthesize these two bodies of literature and propose a conceptual framework for multi-agent-based integrative business information systems (MIBIS) and a unified set of eight orthogonal ontological constructs that are minimally required for any conceptual modeling grammar for the MIBIS bounded universe of discourse.

#!Traffic microsimulation is increasingly a preferred method of traffic analysis for today's transportation professionals. The importance of properly calibrating these traffic simulations is evidenced by the adoption of microsimulation calibration standards by several state and federal transportation authorities. A component of the calibration process is the calibration of the simulation for capacity. Capacity is a high-level measurement that is a function of many lower-level user-defined input parameters. VISSIM utilizes psy-chophysical car-following models that rely on ten user-defined parameters to represent freeway driving behavior. Several VISSIM driver behavior parameters have been shown to have a significant impact on roadway capacity. This paper seeks further understanding of the performance of the VISSIM traffic microsimulator by investigating the impact of driver behavior parameter combinations on a measure of freeway capacity. This paper is intended to provide insight useful for manual calibration of VISSIM microsimulation or the development of calibration algorithms.

#!Language model information retrieval depends on accurate estimation of document models. In this paper, we propose a document expansion technique to deal with the problem of insufficient sampling of documents. We construct a probabilistic neighborhood for each document, and expand the document with its neighborhood information. The expanded document provides a more accurate estimation of the document model, thus improves retrieval accuracy. Moreover, since document expansion and pseudo feedback exploit different corpus structures, they can be combined to further improve performance. The experiment results on several different data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed document expansion method.

#!A new application architecture is designed for continuous, real-time, distributed wireless sensor networks. We develop a wireless sensor network for machinery condition-based maintenance (CBM) in small machinery spaces using commercially available products. We develop a hardware platform, networking architecture, and medium access communication protocol. We implement a single-hop sensor network to facilitate real-time monitoring and extensive data processing for machine monitoring. A new radio battery consumption model is presented and the battery consumption equation is used to select the most suitable topology and design an energy efficient communication protocol for wireless sensor networks. A new streamlined matrix formulation is developed that allows the base station to compute the best periodic sleep times for all the nodes in the network. We combine scheduling and contention to design a hybrid MAC protocol, which achieves 100&percnt; collision avoidance by using our modified RTS-CTS contention mechanism known as UC-TDMA protocol. A LabVIEW graphical user interface is described that allows for signal processing, including FFT, various moments, and kurtosis. A wireless CBM sensor network implementation on a heating and air conditioning plant is presented as a case study.

#!We investigate the structure of addresses contained in IPv4 traffic--specifically, the structural characteristics of destination IP addresses seen on Internet links, considered as a subset of the address space. These characteristics have implications for algorithms that deal with IP address aggregates, such as routing lookups and aggregate-based congestion control. Several example address structures are well modeled by multifractal Cantor-like sets with two parameters. This model may be useful for simulations where realistic IP addresses are preferred. We also develop concise characterizations of address structures, including active aggregate counts and discriminating prefixes. Our structural characterizations are stable over short time scales at a given site, and different sites have visibly different characterizations, so that the characterizations make useful "fingerprints" of the traffic seen at a site. Also, changing traffic conditions, such as worm propagation, significantly alter these fingerprints.

#!Intelligent desktop environments allow the desktop user to define a set of projects or activities that characterize the user's desktop work. These environments then attempt to identify the current activity of the user in order to provide various kinds of assistance. These systems take a hybrid approach in which they allow the user to declare their current activity but they also employ learned classifiers to predict the current activity to cover those cases where the user forgets to declare the current activity. The classifiers must be trained on the very noisy data obtained from the user's activity declarations. Instead of asking the user to review and relabel the data manually, we employ an active EM algorithm that combines the EM algorithm and active learning. EM can be viewed as retraining on its own predictions. To make it more robust, we only retrain on those predictions that are made with high confidence. For active learning, we make a small number of queries to the user based on the most uncertain instances. Experimental results on real users show this active EM algorithm can significantly improve the prediction precision, and that it performs better than either EM or active learning alone.

#!Software Performance Engineering (SPE) methods have been in use for over two decades as an approach to manage the risks of developing systems that fail to satisfy their performance requirements. In general, SPE advocates the use of performance oriented design principles to guide design decisions and predictive performance models to assess the performance impact of design alternatives. SPE methods have been used successfully to identify and overcome system design blunders early in the Information Technology (IT) project lifecycle before the blunders are built into a system and become expensive and time consuming to correct. While the methods have been used successfully in some IT project domains, they are not widely applied in the important domain of Enterprise Application (EA) systems. This experience paper considers the reasons for this and explores the role of SPE as new EA platform and data centre technologies become available.We find that many risks traditionally addressed by SPE have been mitigated by the nature of existing EA platforms, the nature of today's IT projects for EA, and an attention to business process modeling. Furthermore, the design and implementation of future EA systems will see some performance risks reduced even further by new EA and IT system management platforms for Next Generation Data Centres. However, we expect that the nature of EA systems to be built is becoming more complex. As a result some familiar performance risks will re-emerge along with new runtime risks. We believe that SPE methods can help to mitigate such risks and describe research challenges that must be addressed to make this a reality.

To help you understand VoIP networks, Voice over IP Fundamentals provides a thorough introduction to the basics of VoIP.Voice over IP Fundamentals explains how a basic IP telephony infrastructure is built and works today, major concepts concerning voice and data networking, and transmission of voice over data networks. You'll learn how voice is signaled through legacy telephone networks, how IP signaling protocols are used to interoperate with current telephony systems, and how to ensure good voice quality using quality of service (QoS).Even though Voice over IP Fundamentals is written for anyone seeking to understand how to use IP to transport voice, its target audience comprises both voice and data networking professionals. In the past, professionals working in voice and data networking did not have to understand each other's roles. However, in this world of time-division multiplexing (TDM) and IP convergence, it is important to understand how these technologies work together. Voice over IP Fundamentals explains all the details so that voice experts can understand data networking and data experts can understand voice networking.The second edition of this best-selling book includes new chapters on the importance of billing and mediation in a VoIP network, security, and the common types of threats inherent when packet voice environments, public switched telephone networks (PSTN), and VoIP interoperate. It also explains enterprise and service-provider applications and services.ï¾

#!In this paper we discuss a strategy for reducing the computational cost of a re-parameterisation procedure to be used in algebraic numerical grid generation. The re-parameterisation phase is based on a tensor product transformation following given directions. The free parameters in the tensor product are set by solving the discretization of an elliptic differential system of small size, via an iterative scheme, thus generating a grid conforming to the boundary of a prescribed domain with orthogonal inner grid cells and with almost constant aspect ratio. The bases involved in the tensor product are refinable, i.e., they can be written as linear combination of dilate of translates of their-self. This property allows us to use few iterations of the corresponding subdivision algorithm to produce a good parameter distribution.

#!A simple low-cost technique has been developed to fabricate a mold insert for replicating polymeric tapered high aspect ratio microstructures. A backside exposure technique is used to first obtain a tapered sidewall structure as an electroplating mold in SU-8 photoresist on a glass wafer. Nickel electroplating is utilized to form the mold insert. The lowest average surface roughness of the nickel mold insert on the side that interfaces with the glass wafer during electroplating is measured to be 7.02&#x00a0;nm. A novel technique involving use of titanium putty is introduced here to reduce cost and effort required to fabricate the mold insert. Replication of tapered microstructures in polymeric materials utilizing the fabricated mold insert is demonstrated here in polydimethylsiloxane by a direct molding process and in polymethyl methacrylate by hot embossing. The fabrication details for the mold insert are described. Advantages and disadvantages of the use of titanium putty for achieving superior metal surface finish are given.

#!This paper presents a Web-based interior design application named Multiuser Interior Design (MID). We use technologies from virtual reality (VR), the Web, and database to implement MID. It allows users to operate in the VR fashion, interacting with objects in the 3D, virtual space. Users need only a Web browser to view and elaborate designs, examine furniture, place purchase orders, etc. MID contains many useful functions and features Web-based multiuser collaboration. We introduce the user-interface and main functions of MID that users will operate. The technical aspect of MID, including software architecture and underlying technologies, is also presented. MID can be easily modified for other purposes; only information-related portions need modification, and the other portions serve as reusable framework.

#cInformation Retrieval
#index469
#!Intelligent use of the many diverse forms of data available on the Internet requires new tools for managing and manipulating heterogeneous forms of information. This paper uses WHIRL, an extension of relational databases that can manipulate textual data using statistical similarity measures developed by the information retrieval community. We show that although WHIRL is designed for more general similarity-based reasoning tasks, it is competitive with mature systems designed explicitly for inductive classification. In particular, WHIRL is well suited for combining different sources of knowledge in the classification process. We show on a diverse set of tasks that the use of appropriate sets of unlabeled background knowledge often decreases error rates, particularly if the number of examples or the size of the strings in the training set is small. This is especially useful when labeling text is a labor-intensive job and when there is a large amount of information available about a particular problem on the World Wide Web.

#%163057
#!In this paper, a procedure for dealing with the multi-user synchronisation problem in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)-based systems for ad hoc environments is proposed and analysed. We show with this novel approach that it is possible to re-use much of the already extent literature for single-user synchronisation in OFDM and apply it to multi-user ad hoc scenarios. Also a distributed version of the procedure is proposed in order to fairly share out the power consumption among all the devices. The proposed procedure makes use of higher layer capabilities in a cross-layer design and it does not incur too much complexity or power. This issue is specially critical in wireless heterogeneous ad hoc networks where devices can be very limited in terms of transmission and/or computational power.

#index473
#!Conditional random fields (CRFs) have been successfully applied to various applications of predicting and labeling structured data, such as natural language tagging & parsing, image segmentation & object recognition, and protein secondary structure prediction. The key advantages of CRFs are the ability to encode a variety of overlapping, non-independent features from empirical data as well as the capability of reaching the global normalization and optimization. However, estimating parameters for CRFs is very time-consuming due to an intensive forward-backward computation needed to estimate the likelihood function and its gradient during training. This paper presents a high-performance training of CRFs on massively parallel processing systems that allows us to handle huge datasets with hundreds of thousand data sequences and millions of features. We performed the experiments on an important natural language processing task (text chunking) on large-scale corpora and achieved significant results in terms of both the reduction of computational time and the improvement of prediction accuracy.

#!A growing number of business process management software vendors are offering simulation capabilities to extend their modeling functions and enhance their analytical proficiencies. Simulation is promoted to enable examination and testing of decisions prior to actually making them in the "real" environment. In this paper, we illustrate how to optimize simulation models, by presenting two examples of simulation optimization using OptQuest&reg;. In the first case, we construct a discrete event simulation model of a hospital emergency room to determine a configuration of resources that results in the shortest average cycle time for patients. In the second case, we develop a simulation model to minimize staffing levels for personal claims processing in an insurance company. We then summarize some of the most relevant approaches that have been developed for the purpose of optimizing simulated systems and conclude with a metaheuristic black box approach that leads the field of practical applications.

#!We present a broad algorithmic framework for transforming an image comprised of pixels into a vectorized image segmented into polygons that can be subsequently used in image analysis, understanding, and high-level representation. We introduce a new entity-the trixel-that is an adaptive, local, triangular unit of region-contour picture description. Adjacent trixels are merged based on certain elementary heuristic criteria of perceptual organization, modeled as geometric filters on trixel edges. The connected components of a trixel grouping graph, with vertices representing trixels and edges between vertices corresponding to merged adjacent trixels, yield polygons that segment the image.

#!We have explored the usefulness of incorporating speech and discourse features in an automatic speech summarization system applied to meeting recordings from the ICSI Meetings corpus. By analyzing speaker activity, turn-taking and discourse cues, we hypothesize that such a system can outperform solely text-based methods inherited from the field of text summarization. The summarization methods are described, two evaluation methods are applied and compared, and the results clearly show that utilizing such features is advantageous and efficient. Even simple methods relying on discourse cues and speaker activity can outperform text summarization approaches.

#*Data representations and generalization error in kernel based learning machines

#cPattern Recognition
#index497
#%441539
#%531457
#!This paper focuses on the problem of how data representation influences the generalization error of kernel based learning machines like support vector machines (SVM) for classification. Frame theory provides a well founded mathematical framework for representing data in many different ways. We analyze the effects of sparse and dense data representations on the generalization error of such learning machines measured by using leave-one-out error given a finite amount of training data. We show that, in the case of sparse data representations, the generalization error of an SVM trained by using polynomial or Gaussian kernel functions is equal to the one of a linear SVM. This is equivalent to saying that the capacity of separating points of functions belonging to hypothesis spaces induced by polynomial or Gaussian kernel functions reduces to the capacity of a separating hyperplane in the input space. Moreover, we show that, in general, sparse data representations increase or leave unchanged the generalization error of kernel based methods. Dense data representations, on the contrary, reduce the generalization error in the case of very large frames. We use two different schemes for representing data in overcomplete systems of Haar and Gabor functions, and measure SVM generalization error on benchmarked data sets.

#!This paper deals with the bias correction of the cross-validation (CV) criterion to estimate the predictive Kullback-Leibler information. A bias-corrected CV criterion is proposed by replacing the ordinary maximum likelihood estimator with the maximizer of the adjusted log-likelihood function. The adjustment is just slight and simple, but the improvement of the bias is remarkable. The bias of the ordinary CV criterion is O(n-1), but that of the bias-corrected CV criterion is O(n-2). We verify that our criterion has smaller bias than the AIC, TIC, EIC and the ordinary CV criterion by numerical experiments.

#*Two's-complement multiplication
#@A. E. Sheue
#t1979
#cACM SIGMICRO Newsletter
#index503
#!Two's complement multiplication, defined in terms of adds, subtracts, and shifts, is derived from a novel expression relating a two's-complement number and its integer interpretation. Although the derived algorithm is considered well known, the derivation itself is believed to be original and easily grasped. Implementation of the algorithm in terms of computer arithmetic is shown to be safe from overflow except for the case when the multiplier is 10...0 (max. negative). In this case, the resulting product will have the proper magnitude but the wrong algebraic sign. The implementation can, however, be modified to handle this special case properly.

#*Lightweight natural language text compression

#cInformation Retrieval

#!Variants of Huffman codes where words are taken as the source symbols are currently the most attractive choices to compress natural language text databases. In particular, Tagged Huffman Code by Moura et al. offers fast direct searching on the compressed text and random access capabilities, in exchange for producing around 11% larger compressed files. This work describes End-Tagged Dense Code and (s, c)-Dense Code, two new semistatic statistical methods for compressing natural language texts. These techniques permit simpler and faster encoding and obtain better compression ratios than Tagged Huffman Code, while maintaining its fast direct search and random access capabilities. We show that Dense Codes improve Tagged Huffman Code compression ratio by about 10%, reaching only 0.6% overhead over the optimal Huffman compression ratio. Being simpler, Dense Codes are generated 45% to 60% faster than Huffman codes. This makes Dense Codes a very attractive alternative to Huffman code variants for various reasons: they are simpler to program, faster to build, of almost optimal size, and as fast and easy to search as the best Huffman variants, which are not so close to the optimal size.

#!We describe a discrete event simulation model of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV disease, parameterized to describe the dual epidemics in Harare, Zimbabwe. TB and HIV are the leading causes of death from infectious disease among adults worldwide and the number of TB cases has risen significantly since the start of the HIV epidemic, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the HIV epidemic is most severe. There is a need to devise new strategies for TB control in countries with a high prevalence of HIV. This model has been designed to investigate strategies for reducing TB transmission by more efficient TB case detection. The model structure and its validation are discussed.

In the latter group only few propose automatic grid alignment and batch mode. More often than not a program implements only one quantification algorithm. AGScan is an open source program that works on all major platforms. It is based on the ImageJ library [Rasband (1997--2006)] and offers a plug-in extension system to add new functions to manipulate images, align grid and quantify spots. It is appropriate for daily laboratory use and also as a framework for new algorithms. Availability: The program is freely distributed under X11 Licence. The install instructions can be found in the user manual. The software can be downloaded from http://mulcyber.toulouse.inra.fr/projects/agscan/.

#!The hit-or-miss transform (HMT) is a fundamental operation on binary images, widely used since 40 years. As it is not increasing, its extension to grey-level images is not straightforward, and very few authors have considered it. Moreover, despite its potential usefulness, very few applications of the grey-level HMT have been proposed until now. Part I of this paper, developed hereafter, is devoted to the description of a theory leading to a unification of the main definitions of the grey-level HMT, mainly proposed by Ronse and Soille, respectively (part II will deal with the applicative potential of the grey-level HMT, which will be illustrated by its use for vessel segmentation from 3D angiographic data). In this first part, we review the previous approaches to the grey-level HMT, especially the supremal one of Ronse, and the integral one of Soille; the latter was defined only for flat structuring elements (SEs), but it can be generalized to non-flat ones. We present a unified theory of the grey-level HMT, which is decomposed into two steps. First a fitting associates to each point the set of grey-levels for which the SEs can be fitted to the image; as in Soille's approach, this fitting step can be constrained. Next, a valuation associates a final grey-level value to each point; we propose three valuations: supremal (as in Ronse), integral (as in Soille) and binary.

#!Traditional Computer Science curricula focus on the training for logic reasoning and programming skills. System integration is often not covered in computer science curricula. As the embedded platforms migrate from 8-bit microprocessors to 32-bit microprocessors, the engineers require different skills to design modern embedded systems. The Computer Science faculties at several universities in Taiwan have collaborated to design a new course to meet such needs. In this course, we focus on the capability of integrating hardware and software in networked embedded systems. In particular, the students learn the skills for embedded real-time programming, multi-thread programming, low-power network protocols, security, and wireless networks protocol. In this article, we report the design rationale and current status of this course.

The assessment model is based on both a deterministic calculation following the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) methodology in a Danish manual from the Ministry of Transport and on a stochastic calculation, where risk analysis (RA) is carried out using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). After a description of the deterministic and stochastic calculations emphasis is paid to the RA part of CBA-DK with considerations about which probability distributions to make use of. Furthermore, a comprehensive assessment of the set of distributions are made. Finally conclusions and a perspective are presented.

#!A novel algorithm for image segmentation is proposed. The proposed method incorporates geodesic curves and C-V method to raise active contours' performance on image segmentation. Moreover, we extend our method to color images. By practical experiments, it is verified that our model obtains better results than original methods, especially with respect to images within holes, complex background, weak edges, and noise.

#!In this paper, we aim at giving a contribution toward the definition of a UML profile supporting the dependability analysis of real-time and embedded systems (RTES) that conforms to the upcoming profile named "Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems" (MARTE), for which a Request For Proposal has been issued by the Object Management Group (OMG).A set of basic dependability and fault-tolerance concepts need to be included in the profile to support the dependability analysis of RTES. We have exploited the best practices, proposed in the literature, on extending UML with dependability modeling capabilities in order to draw up a check list of requirements to be used as guideline for the definition of a dependability analysis profile. The proposed profile is then applied to the UML design of a case study: a gas turbine control system.

#!Since their introduction as a means of front propagation and their first application to edge-based segmentation in the early 90's, level set methods have become increasingly popular as a general framework for image segmentation. In this paper, we present a survey of a specific class of region-based level set segmentation methods and clarify how they can all be derived from a common statistical framework.Region-based segmentation schemes aim at partitioning the image domain by progressively fitting statistical models to the intensity, color, texture or motion in each of a set of regions. In contrast to edge-based schemes such as the classical Snakes, region-based methods tend to be less sensitive to noise. For typical images, the respective cost functionals tend to have less local minima which makes them particularly well-suited for local optimization methods such as the level set method.We detail a general statistical formulation for level set segmentation. Subsequently, we clarify how the integration of various low level criteria leads to a set of cost functionals. We point out relations between the different segmentation schemes. In experimental results, we demonstrate how the level set function is driven to partition the image plane into domains of coherent color, texture, dynamic texture or motion. Moreover, the Bayesian formulation allows to introduce prior shape knowledge into the level set method. We briefly review a number of advances in this domain.

#!We present a novel interface for directing the actions of computer animated characters and camera movements. Our system takes spoken input in combination with mouse pointing to generate desired character animation based on motion capture data. The aim is to achieve a more natural animation interface by supporting the types of dialogue and pointing that might be used when one person is explaining a desired motion to another person. We compare our voice-driven system with a button-driven animation interface that has equivalent capabilities. An informal user study indicates that for the test scenarios, the voice-user interface (VUI) is faster than an equivalent graphical user interface (GUI). Potential applications include storyboarding for film or theatre, directing characters in video games, and scene reconstruction.

#!Informational logic is a new approach to the formalization of the notion of rational conjecture that is of interest both from the epistemic and the automated reasoning point of view. Given a logical system $T$, an informational logic is based on a new measure of logical information (which is defined on $T$&dash;formulas) and on a mathematical definition of estimate criteria for proofs in $T$. This allows us to obtain a notion of informational theorem $(L,p(L))$ of a system $T$, where $p(L)$ is the probability of $L$ to be provable in $T$. The notion of probability is entirely founded on proof&dash;theoretic concepts. In this paper, informational logic is presented, and applications of this idea to the representation of inductive reasoning and to automated theorem proving are shown.

#!Simulation professionals understand the importance of accurate data for model validation. Traditional sources of simulation data come from information technology systems, manual records from staff, observations, and estimates by subject matter experts.This paper discusses how Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies were used on a recent consulting engagement at a hospital. Data collected through RFID can validate or replace activity duration estimates from traditional sources. However, the accuracy and cost effectiveness of RFID is not guaranteed. A sound methodology was developed, which included rigorous planning and testing of hardware, processes and data analysis.Hardware vendors needed to understand what the simulation required so they could properly setup equipment and software. Also, ED staff needed to understand the purpose of this data collection to avoid anxiety about personnel evaluations. Finally, efficient and reliable issue and collection of patient tags was crucial to the success of this effort.

#!There has been little research into how end users might be able to communicate advice to machine learning systems. If this resource--the users themselves--could somehow work hand-in-hand with machine learning systems, the accuracy of learning systems could be improved and the users' understanding and trust of the system could improve as well. We conducted a think-aloud study to see how willing users were to provide feedback and to understand what kinds of feedback users could give. Users were shown explanations of machine learning predictions and asked to provide feedback to improve the predictions. We found that users had no difficulty providing generous amounts of feedback. The kinds of feedback ranged from suggestions for reweighting of features to proposals for new features, feature combinations, relational features, and wholesale changes to the learning algorithm. The results show that user feedback has the potential to significantly improve machine learning systems, but that learning algorithms need to be extended in several ways to be able to assimilate this feedback.

#!Organizational reformation is inevitable, during the pursuing of larger scales of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). In this work, a case study of the pharmaceutical industry in China is presented to show how process-based simulation can be applied to the quantitative studies on the organizational structure reformation. Through modeling core business processes and limited resources in the sales and marketing division of the enterprise, a simulation experiment is performed to analyze how the employees' working hours distribute in daily work. It is found that salesmen only spend 40% working time on the effort of marketing expansion and sales increase. It takes more than half the working time for them to track the progress of logistics affairs. So, it may be concluded that the company in the case should improve the specialization of the organizational design, and especially should consider outsourcing the professional logistics service.

#%236286
#!This paper describes a novel framework used to characterize a J2EE (Java Enterprise Edition) application and develop models of the application by using Java method tracing in a Java-technology based application server. Application servers are critical to large-scale, online servers and serve as middleware to provide secure access to transactional, legacy and web services. The tracing tool in this framework gives a detailed and comprehensive view of the sequences of methods invoked as the application server processes requests. The output of this tool is processed and automatically summarized into a set of transaction profiles which form the input for a simulation model of the application server and its related components. These profiles have proven to be a useful abstraction of the behavior of the transactions processed by the system. After describing the tool and the model, the paper provides results of validation runs and discusses the usefulness of quantitative measurement, analysis and modeling in some areas of system design and system deployment. The models help architects, designers, developers and deployers explore the different facets of performance during all stages of an application's life-cycle, especially during concept development and prototyping.

#!There is an increasing need for the comprehensive simulation of complex, dynamic, physical systems. Often such simulations are built by coupling existing, component models so that their concurrent simulations affect each other. The process of model coupling is, however, a non-trivial task that is not adequately supported by existing frameworks. To provide better support, we have developed an approach to model coupling that uses high level model interfaces called Potential Coupling Interfaces. In this work, we present a visual, domain-specific language for model coupling, called the Coupling Description Language, based on these interfaces. We show that it supports the resolution of model incompatibilities and allows for the fast-prototyping of coupled models.

#!The Ubuntu distribution simplifies Linux by providing a sensible collection of applications, an easy-to-use package manager, and lots of fine-tuning, which make it possibly the best Linux for desktops and laptops. Readers of both Linux Journal and TUX Magazine confirmed this by voting Ubuntu as the best Linux distribution in each publication's 2005 Readers Choice Awards. None of that simplification, however, makes Ubuntu any less fun if you're a hacker or a power user. Like all books in the "Hacks" series, Ubuntu Hacks includes 100 quick tips and tricks for all users of all technical levels. Beginners will appreciate the installation advice and tips on getting the most out of the free applications packaged with Ubuntu, while intermediate and advanced readers will learn the ins-and-outs of power management, wireless roaming, 3D video acceleration, server configuration, and much more.

#index639
#!The Internet is rife with all kinds of creepy PC bugs. In the first six months of 2004, almost 5,000 new Windows viruses and worms were discovered that were capable of compromising computer security. But the pests that users deal with aren't limited to viruses. They're plagued with everything from spam to phishing. But just because your computer is hooked up to the Internet doesn't mean your PC has to be at risk. In a constant battle of one-upmanship, the forces of good have devised a number of creative ways to fend off these Internet nasties in order to best protect your computer. And PC Pest Control from O'Reilly spells out how you can do just that. Written in a friendly, engaging manner, this handy guide covers detection, prevention and cure, where you're vulnerable, and how to surf the web more safely. It also details how you can protect yourself against adware, spyware, home page hijackers, viruses, Trojans, spam, phishing attacks, and more. For easy understanding, PC Pest Control describes each problem and its symptoms, rates the danger level, and then shows you how to solve the problem step by step. In addition, a supporting website keeps the book's content as up to date as possible, so you're always informed of the latest safeguards. And in a field that shifts as frequently as PC protection, that's a major advantage. So if you want to make sure that your personal computer doesn't fall victim to attack-or if your system has already been infected and you want to start anew-then PC Pest Control is most definitely for you.

#!The increasing proliferation of online shopping and purchasing has naturally led to a growth in the popularity of comparison-shopping search engines, popularly known as "shopbots". We extend the one-product-at-a-time search approach used in current shopbot implementations to consider purchasing plans for a bundle of items. Our approach leverages bundle-based pricing and promotional deals frequently offered by online merchants to extract substantial savings. Interestingly, our approach can also identify "freebies" that consumers can obtain at no extra cost. We also develop a model to extend the capability of the current recommendation algorithms that are mainly based on collaborative filtering and item-to-item similarity techniques, to incorporate product price and savings as an additional important factor in making recommendations to shoppers. We develop a practical algorithm that can be employed when the number of items is large or when the real-time nature of shopbot applications dictates quick response rates to consumer queries. A detailed experimental analysis with real-world data from major retailers suggests that the proposed models can provide significant savings for bundle purchasing consumers, and frequently identify freebies for consumers. Together the results underscore the potential benefits that can accrue by incorporating our models into current shopbot systems.

#t1977

#index650
#!In 1973, a project was initiated at Standard Oil of Indiana to investigate future petrochemical raw stock pricing trends. Although large in scope, the project was simple in concept: a mathematical programming model of the domestic refining industry would be subjected to projected future demand patterns for the basic olefinic and aromatic petrochemical intermediates, and the results would be used to predict industry pricing trends. In keeping with the title of this session, I am going to concentrate on the tools used for this study, rather than the study itself or its results. In fact, I could not discuss the results with you, even if I wanted to, because in the first place they are confidential and proprietary to Standard of Indiana and, in the second place, I don't know them. I guess this puts me somewhat in the position of the man who was hauled into court for returning his neighbor's lawnmower in damaged condition. In his defense, he pleaded that "in the first place, I never borrowed his lawnmower, and, in the second place, it was already busted when I picked it up, and, in the third place, it was running fine when I gave it back to him."

#!Motivated by the September 11 attacks, we are addressing the problem of policy analysis of supply-chain security. Considering the potential economic and operational impacts of inspection together with the inherent difficulty of assigning a reasonable cost to an inspection failure call for a policy analysis methodology in which stakeholders can understand the trade-offs between the diverse and potentially conflicting objectives. To obtain this information, we used a simulation-based methodology to characterize the set of Pareto optimal solutions with respect to the multiple objectives represented in the decision problem. Our methodology relies on simulation and the response surface method (RSM) to model the relationships between inspection policies and relevant stakeholder objectives in order to construct a set of Pareto optimal solutions. The approach is illustrated with an application to a real-world supply chain.

#!This paper presents a design toolbox developed for Philips Design in commission of Philips Medical Systems that provides insight into the healthcare context of rural India. Creating products for this context requires an understanding of the needs of the people within it. This paper discusses 'contextual design' through the combination of different descriptive and experiential tools, used to introduce designers into a context they are not familiar with. The toolbox has been evaluated using different performance techniques with design students. The use of role-play techniques has proven increasing relevance in many aspects: increasing the understanding and experience of participants about the context, creating an embodied and common understanding of the ideas being developed and communicating the concepts in their context.

We apply the framework to model student learning during interaction with the Adaptive Coach for Exploration (ACE) learning environment (using both interface and eye-tracking data). In addition to demonstrating framework effectiveness, we also compare results from previous research on applying the framework to a different learning environment and data type. Our results also confirm previous research on the value of using eye-tracking data to assess student learning.

#!A novel fabrication method for LIGA (from the German &#x201c;Lithographie&#x201d;, &#x201c;Galvanik&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Abformung&#x201d;) microneedles with through holes is presented. Such microneedles are in demand by most bio-medical MEMS applications and in some fluidic MEMS applications. We propose a technique that combines conventional deep X-ray lithography, plane-pattern to cross-section transfer (PCT) process, and alignment X-ray lithography. The technique provides precise hole alignment with &#x00b1;&#x00a0;3&#x00a0;&#x03bc;m tolerance. Finite-element simulations on various hole locations were performed to determine the optimum position. We previously fabricated a microneedle with a 100-&#x03bc;m base and a 300-&#x03bc;m height by a right-triangular mask. The resultant microneedle had a very sharp tip but was excessively steep, and thus resulted in a very low strength. Improved strength and tip sharpness was consequently achieved by changing the mask-pattern from a triangular pattern to a polygonal mask and changing the dimensions of the microneedle to have a 300-&#x03bc;m base with various heights between 350 and 800&#x00a0;&#x03bc;m. Using the proposed technique, we could produce a total of 100 hollow microneedles on a 5&#x00a0;&#x00d7;&#x00a0;5&#x00a0;mm2 chip. Moreover, we successfully fabricated sharpened microneedles that were stronger than that we have fabricated so far. The molding process or electroplating and the cost list of the LIGA microneedle will also be included.

#*High-capacity image hiding scheme based on vector quantization
#@Yu-Chen Hu
#t2006
#cPattern Recognition
#index681
#!A novel grayscale image hiding scheme that is capable of hiding multiple secret images into a host image of the same size is proposed in this paper. The secret images to be hidden are first compressed by vector quantization with additional index compression process. Then, the compressed secret images are encrypted and embedded into the least-significant bits of the host pixels. To provide good image quality of the stego-image, the modulus function and the image property are employed to hide the secret bits into the host pixels and determine the number of hidden bits in each host pixel, respectively. According to the results, the proposed scheme provides a higher hiding capacity and a higher degree of security than that of the virtual image cryptosystem.

#!This newest programming guide by bestselling author Jesse Liberty isn't your typical Visual Basic book. It's not a primer on the language, and it won't dull your brain with arguments hyping .NET either. Its goal, rather, is to make you immediately productive, creating Windows and Web applications using Visual Basic and its associated tools. Written for experienced Visual Basic programmers (from either a VB6 or VB .NET background), the book shows how Visual Basic 2005 can be used to rapidly build modern web applications and new "Smart Client" applications, which combine the power of individual computers with network data resources to deliver a rich interactive experience. You'll also learn the details of building robust object-oriented applications, and a host of especially dangerous pitfalls to avoid when programming with Visual Basic 2005. What makes this book different is what's not included. There's no introduction to Visual Basic, no explanation of how it fits into the .NET world. Why waste time reading about something you'll learn for yourself as soon as you start creating applications? You won't even write a "Hello World" program. With Jesse Liberty, you'll get started building something useful. The book is divided into three separate parts--Building Windows Applications, Building Web Applications, and Programming with Visual Basic--each of which could be a book on its own. The author shares his thorough understanding of the subject matter through lucid explanations and intelligently designed lessons that guide you to increasing levels of expertise. By the time you've finished the book, you'll know how to program with VB 2005. Jesse Liberty's books have successfully guided thousands of programmers into the world of .NET programming, and Programming Visual Basic 2005 will be no exception. This book is sure to become a key component in the libraries of .NET developers.

#!The Carnegie Mellon In Silico Vox project seeks to move best-quality speech recognition technology from its current software-only form into a range of efficient all-hardware implementations. The central thesis is that, like graphics chips, the application is simply too performance hungry, and too power sensitive, to stay as a large software application. As a first step in this direction, we describe the design and implementation of a fully functional speech-to-text recognizer on a single Xilinx XUP platform. The design recognizes a 1000 word vocabulary, is speaker-independent, recognizes continuous (connected) speech, and is a "live mode" engine, wherein recognition can start as soon as speech input appears. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most complex recognizer architecture ever fully committed to a hardware-only form. The implementation is extraordinarily small, and achieves the same accuracy as state-of-the-art software recognizers, while running at a fraction of the clock speed.

#!We makes use of the LoPC model, which is inspired by both the LogP/PG and BSP models but accounts for contention for message processing resources in parallel programming models to derive a general estimate of execution cost. We carry out this cost estimate analysis for three dominate programming models: message passing, shared memory and distributed shared memory. We analyze a typical application SMV multiplication written in these programming models with irregular receiver-initiated synchronous communication. The LoPC estimate for this application is shown to be reasonably accurate when compared against measured values of runtime of actual empirical computations on an SGI O2000 multiprocessor machine.

#!Emotions are of increasing interest to the HCI community. Within the last decade, emotion research in HCI grew from an eccentric hobby of some visionary scientists to a widely accepted field of research. A number of proof-of-concept prototypes and studies have been published, dedicated sensor systems and technology frameworks have been developed, and theoretical considerations have been made. While they all represent a very valuable contribution to this young field of research, they lack a common theoretical basis. Particularly, there exists no applicable model of emotions suitable for designing emotion-aware systems or performing HCI-related emotion studies. However, in order to become a mature discipline, emotion research in HCI needs such a rigorous footing that future work can be based on. In this paper, a suitable approach to structure and represent emotions for use in digital systems is introduced, after a detailed and critical review of widely used emotion models is given and representative study results are discussed. The proposed method meets several requirements of HCI researchers and software developers. It avoids artificial categorisation of emotions, requires no naming of emotional states, is language independent, and its implementation is straightforward. The results of an experiment based on this approach are discussed demonstrating its applicability.

#!We address the pose mismatch problem which can occur in face verification systems that have only a single (frontal) face image available for training. In the framework of a Bayesian classifier based on mixtures of gaussians, the problem is tackled through extending each frontal face model with artificially synthesized models for non-frontal views. The synthesis methods are based on several implementations of maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR), as well as standard multi-variate linear regression (LinReg). All synthesis techniques rely on prior information and learn how face models for the frontal view are related to face models for non-frontal views. The synthesis and extension approach is evaluated by applying it to two face verification systems: a holistic system (based on PCA-derived features) and a local feature system (based on DCT-derived features). Experiments on the FERET database suggest that for the holistic system, the LinReg-based technique is more suited than the MLLR-based techniques; for the local feature system, the results show that synthesis via a new MLLR implementation obtains better performance than synthesis based on traditional MLLR. The results further suggest that extending frontal models considerably reduces errors. It is also shown that the local feature system is less affected by view changes than the holistic system; this can be attributed to the parts based representation of the face, and, due to the classifier based on mixtures of gaussians, the lack of constraints on spatial relations between the face parts, allowing for deformations and movements of face areas.

#!Fusing the scores of several biometric systems is a very promising approach to improve the overall system's accuracy. Despite many works in the literature, it is surprising that there is no coordinated effort in making a benchmark database available. It should be noted that fusion in this context consists not only of multimodal fusion, but also intramodal fusion, i.e., fusing systems using the same biometric modality but different features, or same features but using different classifiers. Building baseline systems from scratch often prevents researchers from putting more efforts in understanding the fusion problem. This paper describes a database of scores taken from experiments carried out on the XM2VTS face and speaker verification database. It then proposes several fusion protocols and provides some state-of-the-art tools to evaluate the fusion performance.

#!Turi (1991) introduced the important notion of a constrained atom&colon; an atom with associated equality and disequality constraints on its arguments. A set of constrained atoms is a constrained interpretation. We investigate how non&dash;ground representations of both the stable model semantics and the well&dash;founded semantics may be obtained through Turi&rsquo;s approach. The practical implication of this is that the well&dash;founded model (or the set of stable models) may be partially pre&dash;computed at compile&dash;time, resulting in the association of each predicate symbol in the program to a constrained atom. Algorithms to create such models are presented, both for the well founded case, and the case of stable models. Query processing reduces to checking whether each atom in the query is true in a stable model (resp. well&dash;founded model). This amounts to showing the atom is an instance of one of some constrained atom whose associated constraint is solvable. Various related complexity results are explored, and the impacts of these results are discussed from the point of view of implementing systems that incorporate the stable and well&dash;founded semantics.

#!This paper proposes a new algorithm to generate a disconnected, three-dimensional (3D) skeleton and an application of such a skeleton to generate a finite element (FE) mesh sizing function of a solid. The mesh sizing function controls the element size and the gradient, and it is crucial in generating a desired FE mesh. Here, a geometry-based mesh sizing function is generated using a skeleton. A discrete skeleton is generated by propagating a wave from the boundary towards the interior on an octree lattice of an input solid model. As the wave propagates, the distance from the boundary and direction of the wave front are calculated at the lattice-nodes (vertices) of the new front. An approximate Euclidean distance metric is used to calculate the distance traveled by the wave. Skeleton points are generated at the region where the opposing fronts meet. The distance at these skeleton points is used to measure both proximity between geometric entities and feature size, and is utilized to generate the mesh size at the lattice-nodes. The proposed octree-based skeleton is more accurate and efficient than traditional voxel-based skeleton and proves to be great tool for mesh sizing function generation.

#!With the development of distributed modeling and simulation, it is necessary for the RTI to support large-scale applications. However, many RTIs can not support largescale distributed simulations with more than 100 federates very well nowadays. StarLink+ is an RTI developed according to the IEEE 1516 standard, which can be used for large-scale simulations with thousands of federates. Great innovations are made in StarLink+, such as its architecture and inner implementation technologies. This paper presents the two-level architecture in StarLink+. The unique architecture has the advantages of both central architecture and distributed architecture. To improve the performance much more for large-scale simulations, two important technologies, i.e. multiple threads and data packing, are adopted in StarLink+. In addition, this paper explains the efficient advancing mechanism in time management and discusses the large-scale experiments with thousands of federates in StarLink+.

This in-depth tutorial not only walks you through the XQuery specification, but also teaches you how to program with this widely anticipated query language.XQuery is for query writers who have some knowledge of XML basics, but not necessarily advanced knowledge of XML-related technologies. It can be used both as a tutorial, by reading cover to cover, and as a reference, by using the comprehensive index and appendixes. Either way, you will find the background knowledge in namespaces, schemas, built-in types and regular expressions that is relevant to writing XML queries. This book provides:A high-level overview and quick tour of XQueryInformation to write sophisticated queries, without being bogged down by the details of types, namespaces, and schemasAdvanced concepts for users who want to take advantage of modularity, namespaces, typing and schemasGuidelines for working with specific types of data, such as numbers, strings, dates, URIs and processing instructionsA complete alphabetical reference to the built-in functions and typesYou will also learn about XQuery's support for filtering, sorting, and grouping data, as well as how to use FLWOR expressions, XPath, and XQuery tools for extracting and combining information. With this book, you will discover how to apply all of these tools to a wide variety of data sources, and how to recombine information from multiple sources into a single final output result.Whether you're coming from SQL, XSLT, or starting from scratch, this carefully paced tutorial takes you through the final 1.0 standard in detail.

#!We consider the problem of congestion-aware multi-path routing in the Internet. Currently, Internet routing protocols select only a single path between a source and a destination. However, due to many policy routing decisions, single-path routing may limit the achievable throughput. In this paper, we envision a scenario where multi-path routing is enabled in the Internet to take advantage of path diversity. Using minimal congestion feedback signals from the routers, we present a class of algorithms that can be implemented at the sources to stably and optimally split the flow between each source-destination pair. We then show that the connection-level throughput region of such multi-path routing/congestion control algorithms can be larger than that of a single-path congestion control scheme.

#!Society today has a wealth of information available due to information technology. The challenge facing researchers working in information access is how to help users easily locate the information needed. Evaluation methodologies and metrics are important tools to assess progress in human information interaction (HII). To properly evaluate these systems, evaluations need to consider the performance of the various components, the usability of the system, and the impact of the system on the end user. Current usability metrics are adequate for evaluating the efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction of such systems. Performance measures for new intelligent technologies will have to be developed. Regardless of how well the systems are and how usable the systems are, it is critical that impact measures are developed. For HII systems to be useful, we need to assess how well information analysts work with the systems. This evaluation needs to go beyond technical performance metrics and usability metrics. What are the metrics for evaluating utility? This paper describes research efforts focused on developing metrics for the intelligence community that measure the impact of new software to facilitate information interaction.

#!In this paper, we propose a convolution filtering scheme for detecting small defects in low-contrast uniform surface images and, especially, focus on the applications for backlight panels and glass substrates found in liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturing. A defect embedded in a low-contrast surface image shows no distinct intensity from its surrounding region, and even worse, the sensed image may present uneven brightness on the surface. All these make the defect detection in low-contrast surface images extremely difficult. In this study, a constrained independent component analysis (ICA) model is proposed to design an optimal filter with the objective that the convolution filter will generate the most representative source intensity of the background surface without noise. The prior constraint incorporated in the ICA model confines the source values of all training image patches of a defect-free image within a small interval of control limits. In the inspection process, the same control parameter used in the constraint is also applied to set up the thresholds that make impulse responses of all pixels in faultless regions within the control limits, and those in defective regions outside the control limits. A stochastic evolutionary computation algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), is applied to solve for the constrained ICA model. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method can effectively detect small defects in low-contrast backlight panels and LCD glass substrate images.

#!In this paper, the Simbus Backplane is used in conjunction with SAVANT/TyVIS/WARPED, a parallel VHDL simulator, and Xyce, a parallel SPICE simulation engine, to model and simulate a mixed-signal ASIC-driven charging circuit simulation. In particular, the individual components of an airbag deployment system are described and modeled in the digital and analog domains. A VHDL-based microcontroller interface is designed to control an analog charging circuit based on accelerometer output. The accelerometer and charging circuit are modeled in SPICE and interactions between the two domains are established through the Simbus Backplane. The results of this study provide evidence of the implementation possibilities available with a mixed-signal system and demonstrate the feasibility of continuing work in multi-domain simulation.
